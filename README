--]- a note about versioning,

        Term-Caca-x.y_z.tar.gz
                  | | ^--------- sub-version of this perl wrapper
                  | |
                  `-`----------- version of libcaca c library
                                 this wrapper is based on.

--]- WARNING

	I normally wouldn't release something that's in an unfinished
	and undocumented state, but I made a promise that I'd release
	*SOMETHING* by June 10, 2005, so here it is.  
	
	It should mostly work.  The bitmap handling code is yet to be
	tested, but everything else seemed to function as expected.

	Unfortunately, I haven't gotten around to writing proper POD
	yet, so those who wish to try these modules out are asked to
	use the source as a reference.  The libcaca documentation for
	the C library upon which this package is based is also a good
	place to look for help.  You'll find that Term::Caca's API
	closely mirrors that of the C library.  The next release will
	be proplerly documented.
	
	For a working code example, look at the little script at the 
	root of the distribution called, "x.pl".  Although a bit crude,
	it will show you how this module can be used.
