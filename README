--]- a note about versioning,

        Term-Caca-x.y_z.tar.gz
                  | | ^--------- sub-version of this perl wrapper
                  | |
                  `-`----------- version of libcaca c library
                                 this wrapper is based on.

--]- WARNING

	Unfortunately, I haven't gotten around to writing proper POD
	yet, so those who wish to try these modules out are asked to
	use the source as a reference.  The libcaca documentation for
	the C library upon which this package is based is also a good
	place to look for help.  You'll find that Term::Caca's API
	closely mirrors that of the C library.  The next release will
	be proplerly documented.
